	</p><h2>Geographical environment</h2><h3>
	Position
	</h3>
	<p>
	Hangzhou West Lake Scenic Area is located in the west of Hangzhou City. It is located in the area where plains, hills, lakes and rivers meet. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides and borders the city on one side. It is divided into lakeside area, lake center area, Beishan area, Nanshan area and Qiantang area, with a total area of 49 square kilometers, including 6.5 square kilometers of lake surface. The West Lake is prosperous near Hangzhou, which is famous for the West Lake.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Geomorphology
	</h3>
	<p>
	Since ancient times, "among the 36 west lakes in the world, Hangzhou is the most beautiful." The West Lake Scenic Area is dominated by the lake and consists of a large number of arbors and shrubs in a well-organized space of different sizes. Plant landscaping is given priority to with rich seasonal changes, supplemented by pavilions, terraces, buildings, pavilions, corridors, pavilions, bridges and pavilions. Around the lake, surrounded by green shade, the mountains are verdant, bridges painted with smoke and willows, clouds and trees covered with gauze. Between the rolling mountains, the nymphs are beautiful and the streams are deep. The layout of the garden uses real mountains and water, history and culture, myths and legends to embellish the scenery with mountains outside the mountain, lakes in the lake, scenery outside the scenery and gardens in the garden.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Climate
	</h3>
	<p>
	It is a subtropical monsoon climate with warm and humid climate and four distinct seasons. The annual average temperature is 16.2℃, the summer average temperature is 28.6℃, the winter average temperature is 3.8℃, and the frost-free period is 230-260 days. The annual average rainfall is 1500 mm, and the average relative humidity is relatively high, between 70% and 85%. With the reverse conversion of winter and summer monsoon and other weather conditions, obvious seasonal changes will take place, forming the climatic characteristics of rainy spring, humid summer, cool autumn and dry and cold winter. Hangzhou is connected with the sea in the east and the mountains in the west. The topography is complex and varied. The geographical distribution of light, heat and water is uneven. The microclimate resources are abundant. However, the instability of monsoon in advancing and retreating duration and intensity often leads to meteorological disasters.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Mountain appearance
	</h3>
	<p>
	The mountains around the West Lake are not more than 400 meters high, but the peaks are picturesque and the nymphs are beautiful. They can be divided into inner and outer circles according to the lithologic difference and the height of the mountain. The outer ring includes north peak, tianmashan, Tianzhu Mountain and Wuyun Mountain. The mountain body is mainly composed of Shi Ying sandstone, and its lithology is relatively hard and is not easy to be weathered and eroded. With beautiful peaks, numerous streams and clear water, it is the area with the largest number of springs in the West Lake. There are Feilaifeng, Nangaofeng, Yuhuang Mountain, Fenghuang Mountain, Wu Shan, Geling and Baoshi Mountain in the inner ring. The mountain is relatively low. The mountain is mainly composed of limestone and is easy to be dissolved by water flow. There are many caves, such as Yanxia, Shuile, Shiwu, Zilai and Ziyun caves. The mountains around the West Lake are the veins of Tianmu Mountain. They meander from west to east. Some of them are like dragons flying in the sky and phoenix flying in the sky. Some of the predecessors chanted the mountain scenery as "flying in the sky and phoenix flying to Qiantang". These peaks encircle the south, west and north sides of the West Lake. Among them, Wu Shan and Baoshi Mountain are like two arms, one south and the other north, extending to the urban area, forming a graceful outline of Hang Cheng space.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Hydrological
	</h3>
	<p>
	West Lake is a semi-closed still water lake with green water in it. The lakes and mountains complement each other. It is a polygon close to the same axis. The lake is separated by Gushan, Baidi, Suti and Yang Gongdi. According to the size of the area, it is divided into five water surfaces, namely, Outer West Lake, Xili Lake (also known as "Rear West Lake" or "Rear Lake"), Beili Lake (also known as "Inner West Lake"), Xiaohu Lake (also known as "South Lake") and Yuehu Lake, of which Outer West Lake has the largest area. Gushan is the largest natural island in the west lake. the su causeway and the Bai causeway cross the lake. three artificial islets, Xiaoying chau, huxin pavilion and ruangong dun, stand in the center of the outer west lake. leifeng pagoda in xizhao mountain and baochu pagoda in Baoshi mountain form a basic pattern of "one mountain, two towers, three islands, three causeways and five lakes" across the lake. The sections of the lake are connected by bridges. The water area of the West Lake includes 6.5 square kilometers of islands in the lake and 15 kilometers of the perimeter of the lake bank. The deepest part is about 5 meters, the shallowest part is less than 1 meter, and the average water depth is 2.27 meters. The water volume is about 14.29 million cubic meters. The north of Hunan is 3.3km long and 2.8km wide from east to west.
	</p>
	<p>
	Since 2002, Hangzhou has started to implement the comprehensive protection project of the West Lake, which has carried out all-round protection and renovation of the West Lake's ecological protection, environmental optimization, continuation of cultural context and construction of a new countryside. The "New West Lake" has been launched eight times in a row. Through the West Lake dredging project and the introduction of Qiantang River water into the lake, the water depth of the West Lake has increased from 1.65 meters to 2.5 meters, and the transparency of the water body has increased from 50 centimeters to 73 centimeters.
	</p><h2>Historical evolution</h2><h3>
	Origin of name
	</h3>
	<p>
	The West Lake was originally a bay. It evolved from a bay to a lagoon, and from the lagoon to an ordinary lake. The West Lake was originally a natural lake and was flooded with waste during its development. West Lake is a lake in Qiantang County, so it is called Qiantang Lake (from Tang Dynasty onwards, "Qiantang" was changed to "Qiantang"), and because there is also a lake connected to it in the north, the water level is lower than it, so it is called Xiahu, so the West Lake is also called Shanghu accordingly. The acquisition of the name West Lake is the result of the historical development and geographical changes in Qiantang County. Since Qin Dynasty set up Qiantang County in the mountains of West Lake, the county government may have moved away from the mountains and gradually entered the plain through the Han, the Three Kingdoms, the two Jin and the Southern and Northern Dynasties. In the 11th year of Emperor Wen's reign, Qiantang County moved to Liupu in the foothills of Phoenix and was promoted to the state administration of Hangzhou.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the second year of Changqing (822), in order to increase the water storage capacity of the West Lake, Bai Juyi built a lake bank near Shihan Bridge, that is, around the Children's Palace, several feet higher than the original lake bank. This was originally the connection between the upper lake and the lower source. The water level of the West Lake was higher than that of the lower lake. Bai Juyi's embankment created a greater gap between the water level of the upper and lower lakes. Although the lower lake has been flooded for a long time, this artificial terrain gap still exists obviously in the two directions of the hydropower station at least in the north of the west lake bank near the children's palace and the west ring road in the east. Bai Juyi's construction of the lake embankment at the beginning of the ninth century was epoch-making for the development of the West Lake, because since then the nature of the West Lake has changed and it has evolved from a natural lake to a man-made lake. The West Lake changed its nature due to the embankment built by Bai Juyi, who still calls it Qiantang Lake. When the name West Lake became popular, West Lake was already an artificial lake.
	</p>
	<p>
	After the West Lake became an artificial lake, the West Lake was renovated in the Wu Yue State era. After the Northern Song Dynasty, Wang Ji of Zhizhou in the 4th year of Jingde (1007) not only dredged the whole lake, but also built the sluice and weir equipment of the West Lake. Zheng Jian of Zhizhou and Shen Lu of Song Renshou era (1023-1063), the former used tens of thousands of migrant workers, denounced fenchyl fields in the waste lake and carried out large-scale dredging. In addition to the six wells, the latter set up a new well with extremely large water supply, which is called Shen Gong well by later generations. Su Shi carefully studied the West Lake Water Conservancy in 1069 in the second year of Yu Xi Ning's reign and explored the plan to unblock six wells and Shen Gong's well. In the first year of Yuan You (1086), Su Shi came to Hangzhou for the second time to take up the post of Zhizhou, worked out a plan for dredging the West Lake, and presented the throne of "Begging to Open the West Lake in Hangzhou" to the imperial court. The paper is the first time that the name "West Lake" is used in official documents. It shows that Hangzhou city has been built to the east of West Lake and the name of West Lake has become popular.

	<strong>Old Ten Scenes</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	Originated from the title of West Lake Landscape Painting in Southern Song Dynasty. Each of the ten scenic spots is good at winning. The common point is that the scenic spots are all near or in the lake. When the Song Dynasty died in the Yuan Dynasty, the ten scenic spots of the West Lake were once neglected and depressed, and the scenic spots referred to in the scenic spots were hard to find. In the Ming Dynasty, the Ten Scenes were restored and made achievements. In the 38th year of the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty (1699), Emperor Kangxi made a southern tour to Hangzhou, marking the ten scenic spots of the West Lake one by one, changing "two peaks inserted into clouds" to "two peaks inserted into clouds"; "Thunder Peak Falling Light" (or "Thunder Peak Evening Light") is changed to "Thunder Peak West Light"; "Nanping Night Clock" is changed to "Nanping Morning Clock". Although "Xizhao" and "Xiaozhong" have only been changed in one word, they have not been accepted by the public. Therefore, only in Qing Dynasty's works on West Lake do they have changed their names. Later, they wrote poems, lyrics and articles, and still use their initial names. After Emperor Kangxi inscribed the Ten Scenes, Zhejiang local officials successively inscribed the names of the scenes written by Yubi, carved stones, erected steles, and built pavilions to protect them. Thus, the names of the Ten Scenes have been recorded from only the books in the past and become the signs of the scenic spots where the Ten Scenes are located. Later, Emperor Ganlong made a southern tour of Hangzhou and wrote a poem on each of the ten scenes, which was inscribed on the shady side of the stele of the king tablet, making the names of the ten scenes of the West Lake more widely known. In addition, many paintings, poems, travel notes and photos depicting the ten scenes in Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing and modern times were recognized as the representatives of the landscape of the West Lake. The ten sights of West Lake except "Leifeng Evening Sun" collapsed in 13 years (1924), and the landscape disappeared. The remaining nine scenes were renovated, restored and expanded. Not only did they take on a completely new look, but their contents also matched the name of the scene.
