	The scenic spot highlights the integration of natural landscape and history and culture. On the north side of Mulong Lake, relying on the historical and cultural landscape such as the Dongzhen Gate of the Song Dynasty and the ruins of the city wall of the Song Dynasty, the scenic spot is built to include Song Street, Banbianjie, ancient Song Cheng, MuLong Ta, Mulong Night Park, Shallow Bridge Fish Shadow, Tinghexuan and other ancient architectural sites with the architectural flavor of the Song Dynasty. Mulong Tower is based on the Longhua Tower of the Song Dynasty in Shanghai and is 45 meters high. Between the south side of Mulong Lake and Diecai Mountain is built an ecological landscape zone dominated by ornamental woodlands, grasslands, streams and waterfalls.

	Geomorphology

	The mountains here are pulled up on the flat ground in various ways. The water of Lijiang River twists and turns, bright and clean as a mirror. There are many caves in the mountain, and the caves are very mysterious. The grotesque rocks in the cave are full of beautiful things, thus forming the "four unique features of Guilin" with "green mountains, beautiful water, grotesque caves and beautiful stones". since ancient times, Guilin has been reputed as the best landscape in the world.
