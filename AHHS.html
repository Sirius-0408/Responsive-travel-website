Huangshan has picturesque scenery throughout the four seasons, enjoying strange pines and rocks in fine weather, changing clouds in the shade, finding waterfalls in flowing springs in the rain, watching Qiongzhi in Yushu in the snow, and listening to Songtao in empty valleys in the wind.
</p>
<p>
March-May and early September-November are the traditional best travel times. At that time, the climate was pleasant, with spring flowers, autumn leaves and colorful colors. The scenic spots are basically all open. There is a high probability of a sea of clouds, but there are many tourists.
</p>
<p>
June-August, Spring Festival, May Day, Dragon Boat Festival and Golden Week of November are the peak tourist seasons. At that time Huangshan was a summer resort, with green hills and green scenery, cool climate, rainy days often accompanied by clouds and clouds, and spectacular waterfalls in plentiful water. The scenic spots were basically open. However, tourists are packed in tents, cable cars are in long lines, and the Peak Hotel is difficult to decide. The plum rains season is from mid-June to early July.
</p>
<p>
November-February of the following year is the off season, but it is a good time to enjoy the scenery. At that time, there were fewer tourists, tickets for the cable car were discounted, and there was the greatest chance of a sea of clouds. You could see the "Five Wonders of Huangshan" and enjoy the scenery in hot springs. It was called a fairyland on earth. However, the weather is cold, some scenic spots will be closed, and the cableway will take turns in sequence.
