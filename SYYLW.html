<h3>
Yalong Bay Forest Park
</h3>
<p>
Yalong Bay Tropical Forest Park is located 25 kilometers southeast of Sanya, the southernmost international tropical coastal tourist city in China. It is the mountain on both sides of Yalong Bay National Tourist Resort, with a total area of 1506 hectares. It is divided into East Park and West Park, just like stretching arms around "the first bay in the world". The vegetation types are tropical evergreen rainforest and tropical semi-deciduous monsoon forest. Its abundant biological, geographical, astronomical, hydrological, human and seascape resources and unique location advantages make it a tourist attraction for tropical rainforest. She and Yalong Bay National Tourism Resort have formed strong differences, complementation and interaction. It is an important extension of Yalong Bay from coast to mountain, from ocean to forest, from plane to stereo, and from blue to green. It has really formed the concept of large scenic spot in Yalong Bay and filled the gap of forest eco-tourism in Sanya.
</p>
<h3>
Forest plant landscape
</h3>
<p>
The forest vegetation types of Yalong Bay Tropical Forest Park are tropical evergreen rainforest and tropical semi-deciduous monsoon forest. It is rich in diversity, with more than 1,500 species belonging to 133 families. Forest structure is complex and seasonal changes are colorful.
</p>
<p>
Hongxia Ridge, the main peak, Zhuluo Ridge, Feilong Ridge, Qingyun Ridge and Longtousling Ridge have special light, heat and rain conditions at an altitude of 250 meters above sea level and have developed into good tropical evergreen rainforests. The main tree species are banyan, sycamore, white tea, closed flowers and trees, rattan bamboo, pine, myrtle, etc. Among them, the tall banyan tree, which often hugs boulders and is superior to the others, has a large trunk and can be folded by several people. Its branches extend and its crown is huge. It can be called the "welcome banyan tree" in the garden. The beautiful phoenix tree, like her name, is a beautiful landscape tree in the mountain, which blooms every May. Another kind of plant should be rattan bamboo, which creeps on the ground and climbs in the forest like rattan. The strange thing is that bamboo shoots do not grow in the ground but on bamboo poles. Perhaps this is how the "cutting off the branches" came about. This rainforest is full of branches and leaves, with various forest types. Its characteristics such as root, strangulation and parasitism are obvious. All species are distributed in three-dimensional and multi-layer and blend with each other. It has the characteristics of Hainan tropical rainforest. < span > Tropical semi-deciduous monsoon forest is distributed in areas below 250 meters above sea level. The main tree species are Cycas hainanensis, Prunus mume, Dalbergia hainanensis, Hedysarum microphylla, Dendrocalamus lingnanensis, Castanopsis hainanensis, Acacia pinnatifida, Elaeagnus angustifolia, etc. Among them, Cycas hainanensis is the national first-class protected tree species, while Prunus mume and Dalbergia odorifera are the national second-class protected tree species. </span>
</p>
<h3>
Wild plant landscape
</h3>
<p>
There are over 30 species of mammals, over 60 species of amphibians and reptiles, and over 100 species of birds in the park, mainly wild boar, macaque, python, civet cat, chameleon, etc. This is also the butterfly kingdom, with more than 20 colorful butterflies.
</p>
<h3>
Geographical landscape
</h3>
<p>
"The mountain is not high, but a fairy is famous". Hongxia Ridge, the main peak, is 450 meters above sea level. There is a group of natural boulders on the summit. The overall image resembles a giant Buddha Maitreya sitting with his hands folded and his eyes closed. A big banyan tree with a crooked neck in his arms is like a leading crutch, lifelike. Local villagers have worshipped the stone as a mountain god since ancient times. This landscape has a good visual effect in the south half of the main peak and even along the seashore. Here, looking up at the sky and overlooking the sea, the pleasure of seeing the sea and the wind is coming. This strange stone landscape is the commander-in-chief attraction of the main peak of the park. In addition to the main peak, there are Weifeng Ridge, Zhuluo Ridge, Feilong Ridge, Longtou Ridge, Qingmei Ridge, Shuanglong Ridge, etc. In addition to the undulating mountains in the park, there are outstanding rocks in the mountain. The famous rocks include sun stone, Feilai stone, wild elephant stone, hippopotamus stone, pig hoof stone, white tiger stone, immortal foot stone, sheep head stone, turtle stone, running water stone, etc. They are both cliffs and cliffs, and also have deep and steep valleys and streams. They are beautiful and agile without losing their depth and precipitousness.
</p>
<h3>
Astronomical landscape
</h3>
<p>
<span> dragon head ridge looks at the sunrise on the sea, which is gorgeous and magnificent, while the main peak has a different view regardless of whether it looks at sunrise or sunset. The mountains are also often seen with clouds and fog barriers coming from the sky and the sea. People are floating in the clouds and desire to be immortal. </span>
</p>
<h3>
Seascape Wonder-"World's First Bay"
</h3>
<p>

Yalong Bay Tropical Forest Park is a tropical coastal forest park with "the best bay in the world". And this will also be the biggest attraction of my forest park. The Yalong Bay is full of charm and charm. Climbing Hongxia Ridge and Yalong Bay, looking up at the blue sky and white clouds, the sun, moon and stars, overlooking the trees in the long forest and the blue waves, the boundless bay is connected to the boundless Pacific Ocean, the white long beach, the five-star hotel cluster, the green golf course and the fields with coconut wind and rice waves form a magnificent landscape picture scroll, which makes people refreshed and ambitious.
