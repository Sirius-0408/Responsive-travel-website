Standing at the foot of the mountain, he can see all the forests, grasslands and streams. Xiannairi, which means Guanyin Bodhisattva, is the northern peak of the three parents' snow mountain. Its mountain looks like a giant Buddha leaning back. Xiannairi is a sacred mountain near the entrance to the scenic spot. Charnodogyi means Bodhisattva Vajra Hand. Seen from the ravine, the snow mountain has a silhouette effect, and rocks and ice and snow are rendered very beautiful.
	</p>
	<p>
	Best place to watch: Yangmaiyong-Luorong Cattle Farm; Fairy is the day-the sea of pearls; Chenoduji-Chonggu Lawn
	</p>
	<h3>
	Luorong Cattle Farm
	</h3>
	<p>
	Backed by three sacred mountains, it is a thoroughfare leading to the milk sea and the five-color sea, and is a pasture for Tibetan people to graze nearby. The Luorong cattle farm is surrounded by endless alpine meadows. Every spring and summer, wild flowers bloom everywhere one after another, which is very magnificent. The Gongga River passes through the cattle farm. Groups of cattle and sheep graze leisurely on the edge. It is a harmonious scene. Tourists who like hiking and picnicking must not miss it.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Milk sea
	</h3>
	<p>
	One of the holy lakes in Aden scenic area is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and is located in the col below the mt. yangmaiyong. it is an ancient glacial lake, shaped like water drops, with blue snow water in the middle and a milky white circle around it. this milky white circle is roughly the origin of the name milk sea. The lake water in the milk sea is of different depths. The nearshore is slightly black due to the precipitation of plants at the bottom of the lake for a long time. The deeper you look, the bluer and brighter you are. Whenever a breeze blows, the lake shines like a gem.
	</p>
	<h3>
	The Five Colors Sea
	</h3>
	<p>
	Between Shenshan Xiannairi and Yangmaiyong is the highest lake in Aden. Starting from the right side of the milk sea, turn up a steep slope and climb another 100 meters to overlook the five-color sea on the ridge. The lake of the Five Colors Sea is clear and transparent. The bottom of the lake is like a grid drawn with ink pens, filled with thick and light blue pigments. If the sky is clear and the air is clear, the plants at the bottom of the lake and the lake will show different light under the sunshine, but the gradual transition has subtle changes.
	</p>
	<h3>
	ocean of pearls
	</h3>
	<p>
	Pearl Sea is a sea child formed by melting snow from Shenshan Mountain in Xiannai and Ri. It is called "Zhuomalacuo" in Tibetan. Zhuo Ma is transliterated from "Dom" in Tibetan, meaning "fairy". Although the area of this fairy lake is not large, it is like an emerald inlaid on a lotus throne in the dense forest, rippling with blue waves and reflecting a colorful world. It is dazzling and is the best place to shoot the reflection of the fairy mountain.

	<h3>
	chonggu temple
	</h3>
	<p>
	Chong Gu Temple has an excellent geographical position in the scenic spot. At its foot there are continuous grasslands, and in the distance there are snow-capped mountains that have not changed for a thousand years. Behind it are canyons. Chong Gu Temple was founded in Yuan Dynasty, nearly 800 years ago, and only after restoration can it be seen today. From a distance, the Chonggu Temple hidden in the colorful foliage forest is very beautiful, as if it is one integrated mass with the world. At present, clay statues of Sakyamuni and Manjusri Bodhisattva are enshrined in the temple. The decoration is a typical Tibetan palace architectural style.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Chonggu meadow
	</h3>
	<p>
	Chong Gu Meadow is the mouth of U-shaped valley of Aden glacier. It is a natural bonsai made up of grassland, forest, stream and mani pile. It is here that the movie "Passing Through Your World" finally proposed. Around the meadow, surrounded by mountains, several snow-capped mountains appear and disappear in the clouds. When spring comes, a new green and a flourishing wild flower scene. Autumn is full of poetry, with strong golden yellow and deep red, which is very suitable for photography.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Hell Canyon of Kasi
	</h3>
	<p>
	The valley is 18 kilometers long. The natural landscape in the valley is similar to the hell valley mentioned in Buddhist books. In the book, it is one of the eight resin forests in the world and the only way for human body to pass from the earth to heaven. The primeval forest in hell valley is luxuriant, with thousands of years of cypress trees, calcified pools and calcified waterfalls, as well as black waterfalls and dolomite weathering mirrors, scales, meat chopping boards, etc. the unique landscape is unforgettable and leads to the three parents' main snow mountain.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Sea of Wisdom
	</h3>
	<p>
	After crossing the Songdu pass on the milk sea, you can find the sea of wisdom by walking along the mountain path. Although the sea of wisdom is not as famous as the sea of milk, it is still worth appreciating. Under the contrast of Yongmeiyong Mountain, the lake looks empty and clear. Every time in the dry season, you can also see the calcified ravines strewn at random at the bottom of the lake, just like an artwork woven from vines.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Frog lake
	</h3>
	<p>
	Frog Lake is the deepest sea in the scenic spot, with an area larger than the sum of milk sea and five-color sea. Every time in spring and summer, the mountains around the lake will open azaleas to surround the frog lake. The lake is blue and green. The azaleas and the magnificence of Mount Sinai are reflected in the lake together. The scenery is very beautiful. If you are lucky, you can also meet frogs scampering in the lake.
