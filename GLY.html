	Historical culture
	</h3>
	<p>
	Gulangyu Island was called "round sandbar" in Song Dynasty and Yuan Dynasty. It was not until Ming Dynasty that it was renamed Gulangyu Island. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Zheng Chenggong still stationed troops in Gulangyu to train his navy division. Gulangyu Island was also established in the Qing Dynasty as one of the five largest Australian cities in Xiamen and gradually prospered. In November 1843, it was reduced to a concession and 13 countries such as Germany, the United States, France and Japan set up consulates on the island. It didn't return until October 17 after 1949.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>①Geographical position</strong>

	</p>
	<p>
	Gulangyu Island, as an island, has formed a variety of sea erosion landforms with various features such as sea cliffs, sea erosion platforms, sea erosion pillars and sea caves.

	</p>
	<h3>
	Traffic inside scenic spots
	</h3>

	<p>
	The price of the battery car is 50 yuan/person, and the operation time is 7: 00-19: 30 (May 1-September 30); From 7: 00 to 18: 00 (October 1 to April 30 of the following year).

For example, Lin Heshou's "Bagua Building" was changed into Gulangyu Organ Museum, which was originally a gigantic "White House" building.
