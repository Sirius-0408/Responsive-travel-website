< span > Qin Shihuang Terracotta Warriors Museum has three terracotta warriors pits, one, two and three. Pit No.1 is a main force array of chariots and infantry, with a total area of 14,260 square meters and about 6,000 life-sized terracotta figures. Pit 2 is the essence of the pit of Qin figurines, covering an area of 6,000 square meters. It consists of four units. The four phalanxes are composed of chariots, cavalry and crossbowmen. They are neat, orderly and impeccable. Pit 3 is the command system of the army and covers an area of 524 square meters. </span>
</p>
<p>
The Qin Terracotta Warriors Pit was discovered in 1974-1976, and the Qin Shihuang Terracotta Warriors Museum was opened to the public at home and abroad in 1979. The discovery of terracotta warriors and horses is reputed as the eighth wonder of the world and a great discovery in the archaeological history of the 20th century.
</p><h2 > scenic spot landscape </h2><p >
The unearthed terracotta warriors and horses can be divided into general, warrior and chariot figures according to their costumes, manners and hairstyles. Each terracotta figure has a different face shape, hairstyle, posture and facial expression. The pottery figurines and horses were originally painted, but most of them have peeled off and changed color due to the fire and soaking.
</p>
<h3>
Pit one
</h3>
<p>
The No.1 pit of figurines in the scenic spot is the earliest excavated pit with the largest area. The pit is 230 meters long from east to west, 62 meters wide from north to south, 4.5 ~ 6.5 meters deep from the surface of the earth and covers an area of 14260 square meters. According to the arrangement density of the unearthed pottery figures and horses, there are about 6,000 pottery figures and horses and a large number of bronze weapons buried in the No.1 Terracotta Warriors Pit.
</p>
<p>
Pit No.1 is also the most complete and shocking exhibition hall pieced together at present. You can see a huge army of terracotta soldiers standing in the pit with different expressions. It is said that there are more than 30 kinds of beard shapes alone. From your own observation, every soldier is lifelike. From armor to expression, from weapons to palm veins, all are amazing.
</p>
<h3>
Pit 2 and Pit 3
</h3>
<p>
Pit 2 and pit 3 are on both sides of pit 1 respectively. Like pit no.1, there are nearly 2,000 pottery figurines and horses of similar size. There are different arms such as chariots, cavalry and infantry, which are arranged in order. Although the shock is not as good as pit no 1, it is also worth seeing because each pit has a different team and function.
</p>
<p>
The terracotta warriors and horses were created on the basis of real life. The artistic technique was exquisite and lively. The terracotta warriors and horses had different costumes and expressions. It has distinct personality and strong characteristics of the times. Bronze weapons unearthed in the pit include swords, beryllium, spears, swords, halberds, pistols, crossbowmen and a large number of arrowheads. Most of the weapons were still sharp after more than 2,000 years, indicating that there was already a high level of metallurgical technology.
</p><h2 > presentation </h2><h3 >
<strong > general figurines </strong >
</h3>
<p>
The senior military official figurines, commonly known as the general figurines, are few in number in the pit of Qin figurines, with less than 10 unearthed. They are divided into two categories: the general soldier figurines with war robes and the general soldier figurines with armor. Their common characteristics are that they are tall and burly, with outstanding temperament and general demeanor. The soldiers in the war robe are dressed simply, but the chest is decorated with flower knots. The front chest, back and shoulders of the armored soldiers are decorated with eight colored flower knots. They are gorgeous and elegant, which set off their rank, status and prestige in the army.
</p>
<h3>
<strong > chariots and warriors </strong >
</h3>
<p>
The taxi drivers are the soldiers on the chariots except the charioteers (drivers). Generally, there are two chariots on the chariot, namely the left and right chariots. The left-hand figurine of the car is wearing a long girdle, with armor on the outside, leg guards on the shins, a middle hat on the head, long weapons such as spears, spears and halberds on the left hand, and the shape of the car on the right hand. The costume of the right car figurine is the same as that of the left car figurine, but the posture is opposite. They are all the main fighting forces of chariots, but according to literature, they have certain differences in weapon configuration and combat duties. Judging from the weapons found around the remains of the chariots in the pit of Qin figurines, both the left and right sides of the chariots in the Qin dynasty were armed with long fighting weapons such as spears and spears, and far reaching weapons such as crossbows, indicating that the division of labor between the left and right sides of the chariots was not very clear. On the chariots, in addition to the spearmen, the left and right figurines of the chariots, there are also figurines of military officials directing the operations. Military officials are divided into high and low and are responsible for directing operations.
</p>
<h3>
<strong > vertical shooting figurines </strong >
</h3>
<p>
The vertical firing figurines are a special kind of arms among the Qin figurines. They were unearthed in the eastern part of Pit 2. Their weapons are crossbows. Together with the kneeling firing figurines, they form the crossbowmen army. The vertical firing figurines are located on the front of the array. They are dressed in light combat robes, with hair tied in a bun, leather belts tied around the waist, and square-necked and pointed feet. Their attire is light and flexible. This gesture is just like what is recorded in Wu yue chun Qiu: "the way to shoot is to have one's left foot vertical, one's right foot horizontal, one's left hand holding a branch, and one's right hand holding a child. this is also the way to hold a crossbow." The gesture of shooting the figurines is consistent with the records in the literature, which shows that the shooting skill in Qin Shihuang's era has developed to a very high level, and various movements have formed a set of standardized patterns, which are inherited by later generations.
</p>
<h3>
<strong > kneeling figure </strong >
</h3>
<p>
Like the vertical firing figures, the kneeling firing figures were unearthed in the eastern part of pit 2. The weapons they held were crossbows, which together with the vertical firing figures formed the crossbowmen military formation. The vertical firing figurines are located at the front of the array, while the kneeling firing figurines are located at the center of the array. The kneeling figure is dressed in a war robe and is covered with armor. His head is tied in a bun on the left, his feet are tied at the square mouth, his left leg is crouched, his right knee is on the ground, his upper body is turned slightly to the left, his hands are in a bow shape on the right side of his body, showing a bow-holding individual drill. In the sculpture art of the kneeling figurines, one thing is very valuable, that is, their soles, with dense stitches, are carefully depicted by craftsmen, which reflects the extremely strict realism spirit and enables the viewers of later generations to feel a very rich flavor of life from the warriors of Qin Dynasty.
</p>
<h3>
<strong > warrior figures </strong >
</h3>
<p>
Warrior figurines are ordinary soldiers. As the main body of the military array, the largest number of warriors have been unearthed in the pit of Qin figurines. They can be divided into two categories according to their clothing, namely, warriors in war robes and warriors in armor. They are distributed throughout the army as the main fighting force. Warrior figures in war robes are mostly distributed on the array surface and are flexible. Armored warrior figures are distributed in the array. Both types of warriors are armed with actual combat weapons, with high temperament and moving in silence.
</p>
<h3>
<strong > figurines of military officials </strong >
</h3>
<p>
In terms of status, the army official figurines are lower than the general figurines and are divided into intermediate and lower levels. Looking from the appearance, the head wears a double-plate long crown or a single-plate long crown. There are several different forms of armour. Apart from the differences in clothing and spirit, the soldiers' figures are also slightly different from those of the generals. The figures of the soldiers are generally not as plump and tall as those of the generals, but on the whole they are relatively tall, with broad shoulders, standing tall and solemn. They show more of their diligent thinking, brave and capable side.
</p>
<h3>
<strong > cavalry figurines </strong >
</h3>
<p>
Cavalry figurines were unearthed in pit 2, with 116 pieces, mostly used for surprise attacks in wartime. Due to the special arms, cavalry attire is obviously different from infantry and chariots. They wore small round caps, tight sleeves, a shirt with the right lapel and the right lapel covering their chests, tight-necked trousers, short boots on their feet, short and small armor on their bodies, no shoulders on their shoulders and no armor on their hands. The clothes are short and light, holding a horse in one hand and a bow in the other. From this special costume, we can clearly see that from the ancient cavalry tactics, the knight's agility is a basic requirement. The image of cavalry unearthed in No.2 Square is the earliest real cavalry discovered in the archaeological history of our country so far. Therefore, it provides very precious archaeological data for the study of cavalry costumes and equipment at that time.
</p>
<h3>
<strong > imperial figurines </strong >
</h3>
<p>
The charioteer is a charioteer who has been unearthed in all three pits. They are wearing long girdles, covered with armor, long arms and wrists, with armguard armour on their hands, shin guards on their legs, neck armour around their necks, scarf and long crown on their heads, and their arms are raised in front of each other as a driving gesture to pull the bridle rope. Because the chariots were extremely destructive in ancient wars, the charioteer's position was particularly important in ancient wars, especially car wars, and even directly related to the outcome of the war.
</p>
<h3>
<strong > bronze chariots and horses show </strong >
</h3>
<p>
In December 1980, two large colored copper carts were excavated 20 meters west of Qin Shihuang's Mausoleum. After restoration, it was exhibited on October 1, 1983. Both rides are four horses and one shaft. It is composed of 3,400 parts of different sizes. Among them, number two is 3.17 meters long, 1.06 meters high, 65-67 centimeters high, 1.2 meters long and 1234 kilograms in total weight. The main body is made of bronze. There are 1720 pieces of gold and silver ornaments for horses and chariots. The total weight of gold and silver is 7kg. The exquisite workmanship and lifelike shape are the earliest unearthed cultural relics in our country, the most complete driving tools, the highest level and the most exquisite bronze ware treasures. They are also the largest bronze ware discovered in the world archaeology.
