Taishan sunrise
</h3>
<p>
Standing on the top of Dai, he lifted up his eyes and looked to the east. The misty fog curtain changed from gray to yellow, and from yellow to orange. The whole sky was red and purple. It changed rapidly. The clouds were in different shapes. The rosy clouds all over the sky merged with the vast sea of clouds on the horizon. It was like a huge oil painting falling from the sky, and it was like a colorful halo on the head of Buddha. Sunrise is an important symbol of Mount Tai. It has always been cherished by tourists, and it is also written by many ancient literati.

	The Jade Plate of the Sea of Clouds
	</h3>
	<p>
	In summer, when a large amount of water vapor evaporates after rain in Chu Qing, and the generated cloud and mist are controlled at approximately the same height, if tourists climb Mount Tai on foot, pass through the Zhongtianmen Gate, enter and cut Yun Jian and Yunbu Bridge, they will feel like entering a fairyland, walking in clouds and driving in fog. When they reach the top of the Jade Emperor, overlooking the sea of clouds below, they will feel like a rushing ocean all around. The low mountains have been submerged by the sea of clouds, and the peaks are exposed to the tops of clouds, like fairy islands in the sea. They will appear and disappear from time to time, and the travelers will be floating in the air

	When dusk is approaching, standing at the top of Mount Tai and looking to the west, one can appreciate the magnificent scenery of "Cangshan is like the sea, and the sun setting is like color". Gold streaks through clouds and mist, plunging into the world. Under the backdrop of the sunset, Mount Tai's numerous clouds and peaks are inlaid with a layer of golden bright edges, flashing with brilliance. If the sea of clouds appeared at this time and the sky was full of glowing rays, the scenery would be even more intoxicating. Everything seemed to be burning between the mountains and rivers.

Its shape is wave, light, scaly, silvery, yellow and white, stretching from southwest to northeast to the junction of heaven and earth. The Qing Dynasty poet Yuan Mei described this golden belt of the Yellow River vividly in "Poems on Mount Tai": "A belt of yellow water is like a garment that pierces the world and connects with the Milky Way."

	Matters needing attention
	</h3>
	<p>
	(1) mountaineering is a physical activity, as far as possible with less equipment, necessities. Food should also be taken less, and it is not expensive to buy it on the mountain.
	</p>
	<p>
	(2) on the way to zhongtianmen rent coat, but suggest to rent to the worse, not too burdensome. The coat is about 10-one for 15 yuan.
	</p>
	<p>
	(3) It is suggested to start from the Red Gate Line when climbing Mount Tai for the first time.
	</p>
	<p>
	(4) climbing at night, one must keep warm and the other must have lighting equipment. At night, there are also many people rushing to the top of the Jade Emperor to occupy the position. It is better to start climbing from Daizongfang Arch to be more convenient.
	</p>
	<p>
	⑤ There is much snow on mountain climbing in winter, and some buses will be shut down. There are two roads from Zhongtianmen down the mountain, one is the classic trail down to Hongmen and the other is the road to Waitian Village.
	</p>
	<p>
	⑥ Don't exercise too hard up and down the mountain to avoid straining muscles. Don't sit in the damp or tuyere during the rest, and don't take off your clothes and hat to avoid catching cold.
	</p>
	<p>
	⑦ Massage the muscles of the waist and legs on your own during each rest on the way to prevent muscle stiffness.
