	</p>
	<p>
	(2) The mountain road is rugged and the road is far away, so it is better to wear thick-soled non-slip sports shoes or hiking shoes, and to have more pairs of socks. 
	</p>
	<h3>
	Matters needing attention
	</h3>
	<p>
	<strong>① mountain climbing takes a lot of physical strength. a little dry food and bottled water can be prepared. no picnic is allowed. </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	(2) wet mountain road in rainy days, rain and fog will lead to blurred vision, it is best not to risk climbing in the rain.
	</p>
	<p>
	(3) Zhangjiajie scenic area has a luggage check-in service between the railway station and the accommodation point in the scenic area. luggage can be checked to the house to be checked in at the check-in point near the railway station. On the other hand, luggage can also be checked to the railway station in advance in the scenic spots, and then you can pick it up directly. Each piece of luggage is 10 yuan. It is suggested that before consigning, it is best to check with the owner of the accommodation to see if there is such business in their home.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>④ the three large groups of monkeys in the scenic spot are "local strongmen". don't provoke them and don't expose your food to avoid being robbed by monkeys and hurting yourself at the same time. </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	⑤ Luggage can be sent to 2 yuan at ticket offices in most scenic spots and will not be lost in general.
	</p>
	<p>
	⑥ Do not buy "Thousand-year-old Polygonum multiflorum" when shopping, they are all fake.
	</p>
	<p>
	⑦ Don't believe what the so-called so-and-so travel agency staff say on the train. They usually sell it to the travel agency at the price of 100-150 yuan people, and the management is not perfect.

	</p>
	<p>
	(2) Most of the shooting spots in the scenic spot are rather steep, so don't retreat at will after selecting the angle to prevent accidents.
	</p>
	<p>
	(3) When shooting rare animals such as plants such as dried shrimps, Davidia involucrata, giant salamander, etc., there is no need to bring a macro head or a fixed focal head. Usually, the focal length used is between 24 and 200, and the lens beyond the above focal length is carried according to personal intention.
