	Liulang township
	</h3>
	<p>
	More than 100 meters south of the grindstone, there is a hill on the east side of the road. The mountain is littered with stones. Among them is a huge stone with a smooth surface on which is carved a figure sitting cross-legged. Like a herringbone roof above, this is the Liulang image.
	
	</p>
	<h3>
	Five lang image
	</h3>
	<p>
	From the parking lot at the south entrance of the pianjianxia tunnel, the newly built 60-level stone steps are mounted. on the cliff in front of a platform, a statue of Buddha with a height of more than two meters is embossed, and the folk legend is that of five lang. Yang Wulang, after a heavy defeat at the Golden Beach, became a monk on Mount Wutai, thus appearing to wear a cassock. However, if you look at it carefully, you will find that the legend is not in conformity with the stone carvings. The "seal of Buddha" (that is, the virtue of the legal world) indicates Amitabha Buddha. The Buddha sits hunched over his feet in a leg press posture called "Auspicious Sitting". Place your hands flat on your legs, with your fingers crossed, your thumb facing the top, and your index finger bent to make a "top grade" handprint. This is the highest palm of Amitabha's nine handprints. He is the leader of "Western Blissful World" and can lead people to "Western Pure Land".
	
	</p>
	<p>
	Why should amitabha be engraved in this place? In ancient times, this rock ridge faced the valley, which was the most dangerous section of Guangou Avenue and was haunted by the legendary "Five Ghosts". Hence Amitabha Buddha was carved, and the passers-by were "blessed by Bodhisattva" and had a safe journey.
	
	</p>
	<h3>
	Kuan Yin Court
	</h3>
	<p>
	There is a small cave on the stone wall of Danqin Gorge. The cave was originally a temple. Gu Yanwu said: playing the Qinxia Gorge "water flowing stones, sound like playing the piano, there is a Buddhist pavilion." Now there are no Buddha statues, only the entrance to the cave.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Playing piano gorge
	</h3>
	<p>
	From the north entrance of the piano playing gorge tunnel to the brook, the cliff is steep and not far to the east. the stone cliff is inscribed with the words "piano playing gorge, five noble heads". this was originally the famous landscape of guangou: "piano playing gorge". In ancient times, this place was full of beautiful scenery. The two mountains face each other, the rock walls face each other, and the Qingxi River flows. The stream flowed down from the gentle slope and between the stone crevices. It gurgled with sound. The rock walls on both sides resonated with it. It was melodious and melodious, such as the clear and melodious sound of playing the piano. Hence it was called "the harp gorge". Chen Fu, a poet from the Yuan Dynasty, wrote a poem here: "The moon is a golden emblem, the wind is a string, and the clear sound is not meant to be shot." Boya has a high mountain tone. It is written in the wind and rocks. " Qing Dynasty poet Wei Yuan described this scene as: "No battlefield is sad, but find the sound of Qin Gorge." When the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway was being built, the hills and valleys in the northeast were cut to the ground, the Badaling Highway was built, and the valleys were filled up with silt and stones that cut holes in the mountain. Now the inscriptions on the cliff depend on each other, and the beautiful sound of the stream swirling around the canyon no longer exists.

	wonderful view
	</h3>
	<p>
	At 16: 30 p.m. on October 14, 2009, a light rain came unexpectedly. The northern fourth floor of Badaling Great Wall Scenic Area was covered with dark clouds, just like a big curtain, while the sun on the west side was already shining. At about 1640 hours, two rainbows, one bright and one dark, crossed the Great Wall. Encountering this wonderful natural wonder, tourists took out cameras to take pictures one after another. Five minutes later, the darkest rainbow at the top faded. At 17 o'clock, the sky gradually cleared up. The Great Wall and a rainbow appeared in the sunshine. Ten minutes later, the rainbow completely disappeared.
	
	According to professional meteorologists, Badaling Scenic Area is surrounded by mountains on three sides, facing water on one side and the Great Wall on the east ridge on the other side. Therefore, when there is heavy rain in Chu Qing in the afternoon, the sun shines from the west side and the probability of rainbows is high, but it is the first time that two rainbows appear at the same time.

	</p><h2>Historical evolution</h2><p>
	The Ming Dynasty's "Changan Hakka Dialect" said, "The roads are divided from now on and extend in all directions, hence the name Badaling, which is the highest mountain in Guanshan".
	</p>
	<p>
	The name Badaling was first found in the long poems of the Jin Dynasty poet Liu Ying: "Arrive at Badaling Late, Da Dan Nai Shang" and "Exit Badaling". In Yuan Dynasty, it was called "Beikou" here, which is relative to Nankou. Nankou is located in Changping County, the northern suburb of Beijing. From Nankou to Beikou, there is a 40-mile long canyon in the middle
	</p>
	<p>
	There is the famous gateway of the great wall, juyongguan, which is why the canyon is called guangou. Badaling stands at the highest point at the northern end of Guangou. Here, the two peaks stand side by side, opening at the same time, commanding, the situation is extremely dangerous. From Badaling down, one looks at Juyongguan, like building a strategic position, like looking into a well. "The ancients had the risk of living in mediocrity, not in Guancheng, but in Badaling." The special terrain of Badaling mountain pass has become a battleground for military strategists of all ages and has always been heavily guarded in Israel. Badaling has become a military strategic location, dating back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods.
	</p>
	<p>
	According to Records of the Historian and the general survey of cultural relic workers, Badaling area has been proved to have built a Great Wall during the Warring States Period, and remains of remnant walls and piers are still found today. Its trend is generally the same as that of the Great Wall of the Ming Dynasty. According to Han tradition, there were two closed cities of Jundu and Juyong. The northern Wei dynasty's "water sutra notes" said: "juyongguan is located in the region of juyong, hence the name of juyongguan. in the south, juyongguan is located in the valley of juyongguan. the stone barrier is the site of the pass. it is not a light achievement. its water passes through the south of the mountain, and passes through the capital of Jing army …." therefore, some experts believe that the Han dynasty set juyongguan in Badaling. Where did the name "Ju Yong" come from? It was Qin Shihuang who built the Great Wall and migrated a group of poor peasants and prisoners from the south to settle in the small basin of Guichuan in Jundu Mountain, which is called the residence of the Yongtu. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Gui Chuan was placed in Yong County (imitating Yanqing). The topography and landscape of the closed site and the flow of mountains and waters recorded in Shuijingzhu are the same as the geographical environment of Badaling.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Northern Wei Dynasty built the Great Wall around Badaling 1,500 years ago. According to records in the book of Wei, the emperor Taiping of the northern Wei dynasty built the great wall north of the capital city of Pingcheng (now Datong) in the 7th year (446), called "Ji Shang sai wai", starting from the mountain of shanggu jun du (i.e. Badaling area) in the east and reaching the yellow river bank in the west. Later, he came to Tianbao of the Northern Qi Dynasty for six years (555). He also built the Great Wall, starting from Datong in the west and extending the Great Wall to the seaside via Shandong, the military capital.
	</p>
	<p>
	Badaling Great Wall was rebuilt in Ming Dynasty. Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty, knew the importance of city walls in military affairs. When he became emperor, he "built high walls" to fortify and prepare for war. At that time, all the state capitals and counties also built cities one after another. Zhu Yuanzhang sent general Xu Da, Feng Sheng and other army troops to build a blockade in the north, build the Great Wall, and step up military training and wasteland in order to prevent the remnants of the Yuan Dynasty from invading south.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 1403, Zhu Di, the third emperor of the Ming Dynasty, acceded to the throne.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 1420, he moved his capital from Nanjing to Beijing. Zhu Di was determined to unify China and made five personal expeditions. His army went deep into the Mongolian Plateau as far as the Enen River in Russia. Only after 1488 did the massive and all-round construction of the Great Wall begin. After 270 years, a total of 18 large-scale construction projects have finally completed a high wall, starting from the Yalu River in Liaoning Province in the east and ending in Bulongji west of Jiayuguan in Gansu Province in the west. This is what we usually call the Great Wall. The Ming Great Wall is more than 14600 li long and passes through seven provinces, cities and autonomous regions in northern China. No matter from the level of engineering technology and the degree of fortification, it is incomparable to the previous Great Wall. In this sense, it can be said that the Great Wall we saw was built in the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, linked to the Qin Shihuang period and perfected in the Ming Dynasty.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Great Wall of the Ming Dynasty was no longer a single high wall, but a defense-in-depth system of "layers of defense". Several city walls and passes were also built in key areas. Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei and other places have all built double lines of the Great Wall, and Shanxi has set up as many as four. In important traffic and military sites, several closed cities and several shorter walls are built, such as the Shili valley in yanmenguan, with 28 stone walls. it can be said that "every inch of land is blocked and every step is taken".
	</p>
	<p>
	Badaling is witness to many important events in history.
	</p>
	<p>
	After the first emperor Qin Shihuang came to Jieshi in the east, he drove back to Xianyang from Badaling via Datong, while Queen Xiao's tour, Yuan Taizu's entry into the customs, the Yuan Dynasty emperor's twice-yearly round trip between Beijing and Shangdu, the Ming Dynasty emperor's northern expedition, and the Qing Dynasty emperor's personal expedition ... Badaling were all necessary places. The number of poems and essays of Badaling chanted by royalty, nobles and literati in past dynasties is even more numerous. Gao Shi, a poet of Tang dynasty, was the first to leave a poem. in his poem, he wrote, "the mountains and clouds are all high when the water and the slope are connected." As for those years of ethnic strife and war, the Badaling Mountains have staged magnificent historical dramas. Now, the sufferings of old China, the 2,000-year history of competing for hegemony among feudal lords and the change of dynasties have all become a distant past. The Great Wall is 100,000 miles long and has a culture of 5,000 years. Times have given Badaling Great Wall a new mission. It is like a precious monument in history, standing on the top of thousands of mountains, shining with the brilliance of the Chinese civilization and wisdom, and showing the great quality and spirit of the Chinese nation's perseverance and perseverance. It has become a bond of friendship linking people of all ethnic groups in our country, overseas Chinese and international friends. It is a precious cultural heritage of mankind.
	</p><h2>Major buildings</h2>
	<p>
	Badaling was originally a pass and was later built as a pass city. From the 3rd year (1569) of Ming Dynasty to the 10th year of Wanli (1582) of Ming Dynasty, Qin Long built barrier plugs at each mouth, and built border towns, tip walls, and horse retaining walls on the mountains on both sides of each mouth. Later, it gradually built the Great Wall and built enemy buildings and piers. Starting from the top of Sichuan Caohua, it is about 12km long from Shifosi Mouth, Qinglong Bridge East Mouth, Qinglong Bridge West Mouth, Wangguayukou, Badaling Mouth, Huamuliang Mouth, Yujiachong Mouth, Heidou Gukou to Shixiayu. Badaling Great Wall, Guancheng, City Wall, Fortress and Juyongguan in the middle of Guangou constitute the complete military defense system of Beijing in Ming Dynasty.

	Fork city
	</h3>
	<p>
	In the vicinity of Badaling railway station, there is a big castle with strong momentum and strong construction. this is the outpost headquarters of the "north gate lock key" guancheng-fork road city. According to "Ju Yong Zhi Lue", Badaling is the restriction of Ju Yong, and the fork is the barrier of Badaling. At that time, there were three "commanders" and 800 troops stationed in the Great Wall of Badaling, which played a very important role in military defense.

	<h3>
	Ancient cannon
	</h3>
	<p>
	Chen Zhan was one of the most advanced weapons of the time, with five iron cannons at the entrance to Badaling Pass. Among them, the largest barrel is 2.85 meters long, 105 mm in caliber, with a range of more than 1,000 meters and great power. The body of the gun was engraved with the words "General of Imperial Power" and was made in the 11th year of Chongzhen in the Ming Dynasty (1638). The gun was shipped from Zhangbao, more than ten miles east of Badaling in 1958. The other four corbel cannons were unearthed during the renovation of the Great Wall in 1957. At the same time, hundreds of shells were also unearthed, all made in the Ming Dynasty. According to the records in the "Military Record," in ancient times, stone was made by machine. The wooden frame of the machine was shaped like a tiger crouching down. Later, when artillery was used, its body was short and bulky, and it was known as a tiger crouching gun, commonly known as a frog gun. This shows one of the weapons at that time.

	<h3>
	Guancheng
	</h3>
	<p>
	There is a temple outside the east gate of Badaling Pass, called Wangjing Temple, which contains the Great Sad Buddha carved out of rock. Outside the west gate stands a memorial arch with a banner reading "drive Hu Wanli". In the 18th year of Hongzhi (1505), when Shaoqing and Wu always built Guancheng, the temple and memorial arch were demolished. Guancheng has east and west gates. The lower part of the west city wall is built with more than 10 layers of granite strips and the upper part is built with large city bricks. The wall is more than 20 meters wide, 17 meters thick and 7.8 meters high. The top is a rectangular city platform, 19.8 meters long and 14.15 meters wide, covering an area of 280.17 square meters, with walls and battlements built on all sides. At 30 ~ 40 meters on both sides of the city platform, one enemy building is built each, which is connected with the wall and forms a corner with the city. Both sides of the west wall are connected with the south wall and the north wall. Both walls are built on the ridge of the mountain. The east is low and the west is high. They form a U-shape and meet at the east gate. The wall is 3.3 meters thick, 2070 meters in circumference and 7.6 meters high. The east and west gates are 63.9 meters apart and the city covers an area of about 5000 square meters. In the 18th year of Jiajing's reign (1539), the East Gate was established, with the inscription "Ju Yong Wai Zhen". In the 10th year of Wanli's reign, Ximen was set up. The door book "North Door Lock Key" is well preserved.

	<h3>
	City wall
	</h3>
	<p>
	The wall of Badaling Great Wall is 6 ~ 9 meters high, with a trapezoidal plane, 6.5 ~ 7.5 meters wide at the bottom and 4.5 ~ 5.8 meters wide at the top. Most of the walls are broad and flat with "five horses riding in parallel and ten people riding in parallel". The Qinglong Bridge area has a steep slope with a narrow wall top, the narrowest point being only more than 2 meters. The center line of the city wall is on the outside, the outer wall is high and the inner wall is low. Both sides of the wall are covered with granite stone strips, which are 0.5 meters wide, 0.4 meters high and 0.8-1 meter long. The longest feldspar strip is 3.1 meters and weighs 1.5-1.7 tons. No matter the steep hillside or the gentle section, the stone strips are laid horizontally layer by layer, crisscrossed, laid horizontally and vertically, biting into one body, and mortar is poured into the joint. Fill the wall with mud and stones, and tamp them down. The wall body consists of 3-4 layers of city bricks, which are glued and sealed with lime putty. The city is paved with wall bricks to make the top of the wall flat. Wall bricks are 0.4 meters long, 0.2 meters wide and 0.1 meters thick. Each brick weighs 15kg. In steep sections with large slope, ladders are built to facilitate up and down. There are brick parapets on both sides of the top of the wall. The outer side is called crenelation or battlements. The inner side is called parapet or parapet. The battlements are facing the enemy and are 1.7 ~ 2 meters high, which is convenient to cover the human body. Generally, the battlements are built at the chest height of the human body, and the distance between the battlements is about 1 meter. The brick at the mouth of the pile is specially made, with one side of the pile being bevelled, and the pile is stacked on the mouth in a fan-shaped shape, with a wide outside and a narrow inside, and a large observation surface. An observation hole is arranged at the upper part of the retaining pile. Perforations are built at the lower part of the wall to shoot arrows and throw stones. The brick faces of some perforation and observation holes are carved with patterns. The inner wall is about 1m high. The battlements and walls are made of city bricks, and the top of the wall is made of a layer of ridge bricks. Both sides of the ridge brick are low and the middle is high, or the inner side is high and the outer side is low, which is convenient for drainage. Roadways with walls are formed at the top of the city wall, and small water tanks are built at the wall roots on both sides. The accumulated water flows along the water tanks to the lower part of the Yu wall at the lower part. The water is led to the water spouts outside the wall through the water outlet holes and then flows out of the city wall. The spout is a stone trough more than 1 meter long, inside the Great Wall, extending beyond the wall. At regular intervals, there is an entrance to the city wall. The entrance is a ticket gate, 1.8m high and 0.8m wide. The door frame is made of 4 pieces of stone with the same specifications. There are stone steps in the door leading to the top of the city wall. The city walls are built with brick water gates across streams and shahe rivers. some are as big as city gates, such as the shifosi water gate. Some are smaller, like a bridge over which the city wall passes. When the city wall passes through the path, there is a gate that can be accessed at ordinary times and blocked during the war.

	<h3>
	Enemy building
	</h3>
	<p>
	Badaling Great Wall has a total of 43 enemy buildings with similar shapes and different characteristics. Among them are wall platforms for patrolling and guarding, and enemy platforms on the upper and lower floors. The upper floor is surrounded by battlements and shooting holes, while the lower floor is a place for soldiers to lodge and store materials. The distance between Taibao is set according to the mountain and terrain. Generally speaking, the enemy building has two floors, 10 meters in height and 10 meters in length and width. All of them are of brick and stone structure. The top of the first layer and the second layer are made into many arches with ladders up and down. There are shooting openings, observation openings and spitting nozzles on both floors. There are cribs on the upper floor. The platform protrudes from the wall and is closed inside the platform. Sixteen enemy buildings, including the fourth floor in the south, the fourth floor in the north and the fifth floor in the north, have been repaired.
	</p>
	<p>
	(1) the south and north fourth floor. Located on the south and north peaks of Guancheng, with 4 enemy buildings in the south and north respectively, it is the earliest section to be opened for sightseeing. The relative height difference between the two peaks is large and the slope is steep. The enemy buildings stand in sequence from lower to higher, with the north and south echoing each other from afar. From Guancheng to the fourth floor in the south, the wall is 685.8 meters long and 127 meters high, with an average rise of 1 meter every 6 meters. Between the third floor and the fourth floor, the mountain is steep, the city wall is about 500 meters, and the most dangerous place is 70 degrees. From Guancheng to the fourth floor in the north, the wall is 767.5 meters long and 155 meters high, which is longer than the south peak but smoother than the south peak. After passing the third floor, it takes the shape of a saddle. First it goes down to the saddle and then it goes up to the fourth floor. This section has more than 100 steps. The Great Wall between these eight enemy buildings was restored in the 1950s. The four enemy buildings in Beifeng were originally two storeys, only three were restored, and the upper layer of the third was not restored. The upper floors of the first and second blocks of Nanfeng have not been restored, and the original bunkers on the third floor of Nanfeng have not been restored due to the foundation of the pillars. Every building originally had inscriptions and steles that recorded how it was built, but there were no steles left. Some of the holes in the hinges and bars of the ticket gates of enemy buildings are still visible.
	</p>
	<p>
	(2) North Fifth Floor. The enemy building with the most coupon holes. The building is 9.25m long and 9.34m wide, with two floors above and below. From the ticket gate to the first floor, there are many ticket holes, each side has 4 rows of brick stacks, each stack is connected by a ticket roof arch, a total of more than 30 ticket holes hold up the ground of the second floor.
	</p>
	<p>
	(3) North 6th floor. The largest enemy building. The building is 12.6 meters long and 8.5 meters wide, with a floor area of about 100 square meters. Seven rows of bricks are piled on the long side and four rows on the wide side, and coupons are distributed on the top of the piles to form a square corridor-shaped coupon lane, and the middle is left empty to form a rectangular patio. You can climb the stairs from the patio to the top of the building.
	</p>
	<p>
	(4) North 8th floor. 888 meters above sea level, Badaling Great Wall is the highest enemy building above sea level. It is the best place overlooking the Great Wall, so it is also called Guanri Terrace. There are two floors in the building with ladders to go up. There are six arrow windows on the first floor to meet the enemy, the number of which ranks first in the enemy's building. The Guancheng platform is more than 1,500 meters away from the Great Wall on the 8th floor of the North, with a relative height of 228 meters.
	</p>
	<p>
	(5) to build an enemy building with bunkers. Two of the newly restored enemy buildings have bunkers. One is the tenth floor in the north, the other is the sixth floor in the south. The shed is a small house built on the second floor, with hard peaks and carved windows and red pillars.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Pier abutment
	</h3>
	<p>
	Also known as beacon towers. On the eastern and western hills outside the Badaling Great Wall, there is a pier. The piers and abutments are all five feet high. Small towns are built around them, one foot high and five feet high. Hanging buildings and wooden bases are set up on the piers and abutments, and trenches and suspension bridges are set up under the piers and abutments. Pits are set up outside the piers and abutments. Water cabinets are installed on doorways to hold ice in winter and water in summer. If you don't repair steps, use rope ladders to get up and down. Each unit has 2 guns, 2 guns, and 10 guards. It is guarded by troops stationed in nearby castles and forms a defense-in-depth network with the castles. In the second year of Chenghua of Ming Dynasty (1466), it was stipulated that the enemy should attack more than 100 people with one attack and one gun. More than 500 people, two soldiers and two cannons; More than 1,000 people, three beacons and three cannons; More than 5,000 people, four soldiers and four cannons; More than 10,000 people, five battles and five cannons.
	</p>
	<h3>
	City terrace
	</h3>
	<p>
	Also known as the wall table. Refers to a platform-type building slightly higher than the top of the long city wall and surrounded by castellated walls, crenels, shooting holes, etc. This is the place where the ancient soldiers patrolled and guarded, and where they defended themselves during the war. For example, the platform at the top of the gate at Badaling Pass is called Chengtai.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Battle station
	</h3>
	<p>
	Built along the Great Wall, the main traffic arteries or the dangerous terrain are blockhouses with one, two or three floors and varying sizes. Weapons, ammunition and other strategic materials can be stored inside, and the effect is greater than that of enemy buildings. According to Records of the Four Towns and Three Gates written by Liu Xiaozu in the Ming Dynasty, under the planning and supervision of Qi Jiguang, a total of 1,200 enemy and battle stations were built along the Great Wall from Shanhaiguan to Beijing (3,000 were originally planned). When a war breaks out, on the enemy's platform, one can "strike from top to bottom with firearms, Buddha's lang machine, and mother and son guns" and "use up all weapons and replace them with artillery". A war table usually requires 30 people to guard the table, 30 people to guard the battlements, divided into 6.5, and 300 kg of gunpowder. In addition, there are still magic arrows, iron bars and thousands of large and small stones on the battleground. At the same time, one-month rations and water are also stored. This kind of "well-made, sophisticated and skillful" war platform facility can attack and hold, and can cooperate closely with the city platform, enemy platform (enemy building) and other military facilities on the Great Wall to form a dense fire net, greatly enhancing the combat power, effectively blocking enemy attacks by riding, and playing a very important strategic and tactical role in military defense.
	< /p><h2 > honours and other </h2><p >
	In 1961, it was released by the State Council as a national key cultural relic protection unit. In 1988, Badaling Great Wall was listed as a world cultural heritage by the United Nations. In 1991, Badaling ranked first in the top 40 national scenic spots. In 2007, the National Tourism Administration awarded the national 5A grade scenic spot.
