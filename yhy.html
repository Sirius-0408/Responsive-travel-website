The main scenic spot of the Summer Palace consists of Longevity Hill and Kunming Lake. The whole garden covers an area of 3.08 square kilometers and the water surface accounts for about three quarters. The park now has 70,000 square meters of palaces and gardens, and is famous for its precious cultural relics. It is the first batch of national key cultural relics protection units.

The Summer Palace, formerly known as the Qingyi Garden, was built in the 15th year of Ganlong (1750) and the 10th year of Xianfeng (1860) in the Qing Dynasty and burned down by the Anglo-French coalition. In the 12th year of Guangxu's reign (1886), the Qing government appropriated funds from the navy and other funds to begin reconstruction. two years later, it took its present name as a home for empress dowager cixi. In 2000, it was destroyed by the allied forces of eight countries and repaired in 2002. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, after several renovations, the Summer Palace has successively restored four major scenic spots, including the Four Continents, Suzhou Street, Jingming Building, Suining Hall, Wenchang Hospital, Gengzhitu, etc.
</p>
<p>

The word "sea of wisdom" is used in Buddhism, and its original intention is to praise Buddha's wisdom like the sea and boundless Buddhism. Although the building is very much like a wooden structure, it is actually not a single piece of wood. It is all made of Shi Zhuan coupons and has no purlin to support the load. Therefore, it is called "Liang Wu Dian". It is also called "the boundless temple" because the boundless Buddha is enshrined in the temple.

	The original Weng Mountain in the northwest suburb of Beijing is the Yanshan vein. There are lakes under the mountain, which are called Qili, Dabo Lake, Weng Mountain Park and West Lake. In 1153 of the first year of Zhenyuan in the Jin Dynasty, Yan Hong Liang, the gold owner, set up the Jinshan Palace here. After the Yuan Dynasty established its capital in Beijing, in order to meet the demand for water for grain transportation, Guo Shoujing, a water conservancy scientist, opened up an upstream water source and introduced the Shenshan spring water from Baifu Village in Changping and the flowing water along the way into the lake, thus increasing the water potential and becoming a water storage reservoir for the palace and grain transportation.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the 7th year of Hongzhi of the Ming Dynasty (1494), Nannie of Emperor Xiaozong of the Ming Dynasty helped his wife Roche to build Yuanjing Temple in front of Weng Mountain, which was later abandoned. Since then, the gardens around Weng Mountain have gradually increased. The Ming emperor Wu zong built a palace on the lakeside, called "haoshan garden", a royal garden. Both Emperor Wu of Ming Dynasty and Ming Shenzong used to go boating here. During the reign of Emperor Xi of Ming Dynasty, Wei Zhongxian once owned Haoshanyuan.

	In the early years of Ganlong in the Qing Dynasty, there were more gardens in the Haidian area in the western suburbs of Beijing. A large amount of garden water increased the water consumption day by day. At that time, besides the Wanquan River, which had a small flow, garden water came from Yuquan Mountain and flowed into the West Lake, which was also the water source of Tonghui River since the Ming Dynasty. In the 15th year of Ganlong (1750), in order to prepare for the 60th birthday of Queen Chongde (Empress Xiao Shengxian), Ganlong Emperor ordered the excavation of the West Lake under the pretext of harnessing the water system in the west of Beijing, intercepting the water from the West Mountain, Yuquan Mountain and Shouanshan Mountain, and digging a high-water lake and a water-raising lake in the west of the West Lake, using these three lakes as water storage reservoirs to ensure water for palace gardens and to provide irrigation water for the surrounding farmland. Emperor Ganlong changed the name of the West Lake to Kunming Lake based on the story of Emperor Wu of Han who dug the Kunming pool to drill for water troops. He piled up the earth from the dug lake on Weng Mountain in Hubei and renamed Weng Mountain Wanshou Mountain.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 1764, Ganlong completed the construction of Qingyi Garden, costing more than 4.8 million taels of silver. The Qingyi Garden uses the concept of "Three Fairy Mountains on the Sea" in ancient Chinese mythology to build three small islands in Kunming Lake and the two lakes on the west side: Nanhu Island, Tuancheng Island and Zaojiantang Island, which are compared to the three mountains on the sea: Penglai, Abbot and Yingzhou. The overall planning of Qingyi Garden is based on the West Lake in Hangzhou. At the same time, Jiangnan gardens and scenic spots are extensively imitated. For example, Phoenix Pier imitates Taihu Lake, Jingming Building imitates Yueyang Building, Wangchan Pavilion imitates Yellow Crane Tower, Houxi Lake Buying and Selling Street imitates Suzhou Water Street, Xisuo Buying and Selling Street imitates Yangzhou 24th Bridge, etc. The main building in the park is yanshou temple, and there is a corridor over 700 feet long. Its architecture and decorative painting are quite wonderful, with artistic value and numerous sightseeing buildings. There are very few administrative and residential buildings in Qingyi Garden of Wanshou Mountain in the Summer Palace. Emperor Ganlong visited Qingyi Garden on the same day and never lived in the garden.

	In its heyday, the Summer Palace was large-scale and covered an area of 2.97 square kilometers (293 hectares). It was mainly composed of Wanshou Mountain and Kunming Lake, with three quarters (about 220 hectares) of water surface. The buildings in the park are centered on Foxiang Pavilion. There are over 100 scenic buildings, over 20 large and small courtyards, and 3,555 ancient buildings with an area of over 70,000 square meters. There are more than 3,000 buildings in different forms such as pavilions, terraces, buildings, pavilions, corridors and pavilions. Among them, Buddha Fragrance Pavilion, Long Corridor, Stone Boat, Suzhou Street, Seventeen-hole Bridge, Fun Garden and Grand Stage are representative buildings. There are more than 1600 ancient and famous trees.

	After the Daoguang years of the Qing Dynasty, due to the weak national strength, it was announced to withdraw the furnishings of the Three Mountains, and the Qingyi Garden was gradually abandoned. In the 10th year of Xianfeng (1860), Qingyi Garden was burned down by the Anglo-French coalition. From the 10th to 21st years of Guangxu (1884 to 1895), he retired to recuperate for Empress Dowager Cixi and ordered the reconstruction of Qingyi Garden in the name of Emperor Guangxu. Due to limited funds, it concentrated its financial resources on repairing Qianshan complex, and built a wall around Kunming Lake, renamed the Summer Palace and became a detached palace. In the 26th year of Guangxu's reign (1900), the buildings and cultural relics in the garden were destroyed by the allied forces of the eight countries. In the 28th year of Guangxu's reign (1902), they were restored. Although the Summer Palace has largely restored the landscape of Qingyi Garden, many of its qualities have declined. Many high-rise buildings have been reduced in size due to funding. For example, the Wenchangge tower has been reduced from three to two floors, the Le Shoutang has been changed from double eaves to single eaves, and there are also heightened buildings, such as the grand opera building. Suzhou street was burned down and never recovered. Due to Cixi's preference for Su-style colored paintings, the colored paintings in many houses' pavilions and verandas have also changed from Hexi colored paintings to Su-style colored paintings, changing the original appearance of Qingyi Garden in detail.
	</p>
	<p>
	On December 25 of the 3rd year of Xuantong reign (1911), Pu Yi abdicated. As Pu Yi's private property, the Summer Palace was still managed by the Qing Dynasty's internal affairs office.
	</p>
	<p>
	Due to the shortage of royal funds year by year and the depletion of financial resources for the Qing Dynasty, on January 14, 1914, in order to subsidize the garden finance, the Qing Dynasty's internal affairs office changed the Summer Palace into a ticketing tour. In April, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Office of Internal Affairs of the Qing Dynasty agreed that "during the open tour, there will be a fund-raising intention" and proposed the "Regulations for the Trial Sale of Tickets in the Summer Palace and Other Places". It is stipulated that tickets will be officially sold to the public from May 6.
